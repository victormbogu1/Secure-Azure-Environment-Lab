## üîë 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM ensures that **only authorized users and systems** can access resources while following **least privilege principles**.

**Key Concepts:**  
- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** Grant the minimal permissions needed.  
- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):** Assign roles instead of direct permissions.  
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM):** Provide just-in-time elevated access.  
- **Conditional Access:** Enforce login policies based on device, risk, or location.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Add an additional security layer.  
- **Managed Identities:** Enable secure, passwordless access for applications.  

üéØ **Goal:** Prevent unauthorized access and privilege abuse.

---

## üìú 2. Logging & Monitoring  

Comprehensive logging provides full visibility into resource activities and user behavior.  

**Key Components:**  
- **Azure Monitor & Log Analytics:** Centralize log ingestion.  
- **Azure Activity Logs:** Track resource operations and changes.  
- **Azure AD Sign-In Logs:** Detect abnormal login attempts.  
- **Microsoft Defender & Sentinel:** Enable proactive threat detection and SIEM capabilities.  
- **Audit Logs:** Record configuration and policy changes.  
- **Retention Policies:** Define data storage duration for compliance.  

üéØ **Goal:** Detect, investigate, and respond to incidents effectively.

---

## üîê 3. Encryption  

Encryption ensures that sensitive data remains protected both **at rest** and **in transit**.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- **Encryption in Transit:** Secure communication via TLS/HTTPS.  
- **Encryption at Rest:** Protect storage, database, and VM disks.  
- **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK):** Control encryption with your own keys in Key Vault.  
- **Secrets Management:** Store credentials securely ‚Äî never hardcode them.  
- **Key Rotation:** Automate and enforce cryptographic hygiene.  

üéØ **Goal:** Maintain data confidentiality, integrity, and compliance.

---

## üåê 4. Network Segmentation  

Proper segmentation limits exposure and minimizes lateral movement within the environment.  

**Key Concepts:**  
- **Virtual Networks (VNets):** Isolate workloads by function.  
- **Subnets & NSGs:** Apply firewall rules for traffic flow control.  
- **Zero Trust Architecture:** Always verify before granting access.  
- **Azure Bastion:** Secure VM access without exposing public IPs.  
- **Private Endpoints:** Enable private connections to Azure services.  
- **Azure Firewall/WAF:** Add an extra inspection layer for inbound/outbound protection.  

üéØ **Goal:** Reduce the attack surface and contain potential threats.

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Integrated Security Layers  

| Common Breach Cause | Mitigation Strategy |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Compromised accounts | Strong IAM + MFA |
| Undetected threats | Continuous logging + Sentinel |
| Data exposure | Encryption in transit & at rest |
| Malware spread | Network segmentation & NSG rules |

Each of these layers works together to create a **resilient, zero-trust cloud environment**.

   - Auto-rotation: Enabled
   - Notify on rotation

### üåê Step 4: Network Segmentation

   - Subnets: app-subnet (10.0.1.0/24), db-subnet (10.0.2.0/24)

2. Create NSGs:
   - app-nsg: Inbound HTTPS, Outbound Web
   - db-nsg: Inbound SQL, Outbound Deny

3. Associate NSGs with subnets.

4. Deploy VMs:
   - App VM: app-subnet
   - DB VM: db-subnet

5. Enable Azure Bastion for secure RDP/SSH
- AzureBastionSubnet (10.0.3.0/26) Bastion Host: securelab-bastion ---+ (Secure RDP/SSH - No Public IPs)

### üß± Step 5: Defender & Sentinel:

- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on Storage, Key Vault, Servers, Network.
- Add Azure Sentinel to 'secure-lab-logs'.
- Create rules for blob deletion, failed logins, and unusual network traffic.
- Test and verify alerting.

### üîí Step 6: Private Endpoints:

- Create private endpoints for Storage & Key Vault.
- Connect to 'securelab-vnet' ‚Üí 'db-subnet'.
- Disable public network access.
- Verify private connectivity.

### ‚úÖ Step 7: Final Verification

- Check logs in Log Analytics.
- Confirm Defender & Sentinel monitoring.
- Test alerts and key rotation.

## üß∞ Troubleshooting Summary  

During deployment, several challenges were identified and resolved to ensure a seamless setup.  
Common issues included **RBAC propagation delays**, **Key Vault permission errors**, and **network rule misconfigurations**.  

Each was resolved through:
- Assigning correct **Key Vault Crypto Officer** roles to managed identities.  
- Allowing propagation time for **RBAC role assignments** (5‚Äì10 minutes).  
- Adjusting **key rotation policies** to comply with Azure limits.  
- Fine-tuning **NSG rules** to allow required inter-VM communication.  

This troubleshooting process reinforces the importance of patience, validation, and role verification when managing complex Azure environments.
