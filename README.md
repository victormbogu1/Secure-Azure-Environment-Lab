## 🔑 1. Identity and Access Management (IAM)

IAM ensures only the **right people or systems** have access to resources with the **least privilege**.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):** Grant minimal permissions.  
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Assign roles instead of direct permissions.  
- **Privileged Identity Management (PIM):** Temporary admin access.  
- **Conditional Access Policies:** Secure logins based on device, location, or risk.  
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds extra security.  
- **Service Principals & Managed Identities:** For secure, credential-free app access.  

**🎯 Goal:** Prevent attackers from misusing accounts.

## 📜 2. Logging

Logging provides visibility and an **audit trail**.

**Key Components:**

- **Azure Monitor & Log Analytics:** Centralized log collection.  
- **Azure Activity Logs:** Tracks management-plane activities.  
- **Azure AD Sign-In Logs:** Detect suspicious logins.  
- **Microsoft Defender & Sentinel:** Advanced threat detection and SIEM/SOAR.  
- **Audit Logs:** Track configuration changes and policy violations.  
- **Retention Policies:** Define how long logs are kept.  

**🎯 Goal:** Detect, investigate, and respond to threats quickly.

## 🔐 3. Encryption

Encryption protects data confidentiality and integrity.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Encryption in Transit:** TLS/HTTPS for all communications.  
- **Encryption at Rest:** Understand Azure Storage/Database/VM defaults.  
- **Customer-Managed Keys (CMK):** Use Key Vault for custom keys.  
- **Secrets Management:** Avoid hardcoding passwords/keys.  
- **Disk Encryption:** Enable Azure Disk Encryption for sensitive VMs.  

**🎯 Goal:** Keep data safe even if systems are compromised.

---

## 🌐 4. Network Segmentation

Segment networks to **limit attack surfaces**.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Virtual Networks (VNets):** Isolate workloads.  
- **Subnets:** Divide VNets by trust levels.  
- **Network Security Groups (NSGs):** Control traffic per subnet/NIC.  
- **Firewalls & WAF:** Inspect traffic between segments.  
- **Zero Trust Principles:** Always verify access.  
- **Private Endpoints:** Secure service connectivity.  
- **Environment Segregation:** Keep dev/test/prod separate.  

**🎯 Goal:** Prevent lateral movement after compromise.

## ✅ 5. Putting It All Together

By mastering **IAM, Logging, Encryption, and Network Segmentation**, you mitigate **80% of cloud security risks**.  

| Common Breach Cause | Mitigation |
|--------------------|------------|
| Compromised accounts | Strong IAM + MFA |
| Undetected attacks | Logging & Sentinel |
| Exposed data | Encryption at rest & transit |
| Malware spread | Network segmentation |

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Implementation

Follow these steps to **replicate this secure Azure environment**.

---

### 🔑 Step 1: IAM

```text
1. Create Resource Group:
   Name: secure-lab-rg
   Region: Germany West Central

2. Enable MFA in Azure AD for admins.

3. Assign RBAC roles:
   - Owner/Contributor for admins
   - Reader for monitoring
   - Key Vault Crypto Officer for encryption

4. Implement least privilege using custom roles if needed.

5. Enable System-assigned Managed Identity for VMs and Storage.

📜 Step 2: Logging:

1. Create Log Analytics Workspace:
   Name: secure-lab-logs
   Resource Group: secure-lab-rg

2. Connect Diagnostic Logs for Storage, Key Vault, and VMs.

3. Test logging by uploading/deleting files.

4. Create alerts:
   - Scope: secure-lab-logs
   - Condition: query results > 0
   - Action: send email
   - Name: Blob Deletion Alert

🔐 Step 3: Encryption:

1. Create Key Vault: securelab-keyvault
   - Access: Azure RBAC
   - Soft Delete: Enabled

2. Generate Key: storageencryptionkey (RSA 2048)

3. Enable CMK encryption on Storage Account using Key Vault.

4. Configure Key Rotation:
   - Expiry: 180 days
   - Auto-rotation: Enabled
   - Notify on rotation

🌐 Step 4: Network Segmentation

1. Create VNet: securelab-vnet (10.0.0.0/16)
   - Subnets: app-subnet (10.0.1.0/24), db-subnet (10.0.2.0/24)

2. Create NSGs:
   - app-nsg: Inbound HTTPS, Outbound Web
   - db-nsg: Inbound SQL, Outbound Deny

3. Associate NSGs with subnets.

4. Deploy VMs:
   - App VM: app-subnet
   - DB VM: db-subnet

5. Optional: Enable Azure Bastion for secure RDP/SSH

🧱 Step 5: Defender & Sentinel:

- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud on Storage, Key Vault, Servers, Network.
- Add Azure Sentinel to 'secure-lab-logs'.
- Create rules for blob deletion, failed logins, and unusual network traffic.
- Test and verify alerting.

🔒 Step 6: Private Endpoints:

- Create private endpoints for Storage & Key Vault.
- Connect to 'securelab-vnet' → 'db-subnet'.
- Disable public network access.
- Verify private connectivity.

✅ Step 7: Final Verification

- Check logs in Log Analytics.
- Confirm Defender & Sentinel monitoring.
- Test alerts and key rotation.

## 🧾 Conclusion

You’ve built a **secure, monitored, and segmented Azure environment**:

| Area             | Implementation             |
|-----------------|----------------------------|
| IAM              | RBAC & MFA                 |
| Logging          | Centralized logs & alerts  |
| Encryption       | Key Vault & CMK            |
| Network Security | NSGs, subnets, Bastion     |
| Monitoring       | Defender & Sentinel        |

This project demonstrates **real-world Azure security practices**.
